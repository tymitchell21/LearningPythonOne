					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi guys, my name is Tyler!  I am a 23 year 
					old undergraduate student at IUPUI in Indianapolis, IN.  Also, I work at Rick's
					Cafe Boatyard here in Indy, which is where the sunset picture above was taken.  
					I am studying computer science and would someday like to combine computers and the outdoors 
					into some form of a lifestyle/career.  For now I am just going to school and 
					taking mini-adventures any chance that I get.
				</p>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my hobbies include snowboarding, hiking 
					, mountain biking, writing, reading, programming, and I am a huge film and music buff.  
					Most of all, I love when film and music combine together and compliment each 
					other perfectly to create an emotionally charged creation.  Also I am always up
					for trying something new and exciting.  I love to meet new people.<br><br>
					
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that escaping the safety of society and
					launching yourself into scary and unknown situations is the only way in this World
					to grow and transform who you are.  Therefor, I try to scare the shit out of myself
					frequently.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently I am attempting to save up some money to take
					a trip abroad somewhere in India or perhaps Southeast Asia.  This is the main reason 
					that I created Quaestios.com, so that I could track my progress and you guys could
					see how it is coming along and possibly learn some stuff through my experiences.  Quaestio 
					is latin for to question.  I thought it was cool that it meant to question and it also
					resembled quests and this questioning through quests is exactly what I wanted to capture 
					with my blog.  Sort of an adventure of searching for answers.<br><br>
					
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can check out <a class="read" href="myBlog.html">my blogs here</a> or <a class="read" href="budget.html">my budget plan 
					for saving here</a>.  Also if you are looking to ask me any question at all just go to my
