        	<h2>Purpose</h2>
        		<p>The purpose of the Hendricks Pain Consulting website is to provide a resource for patients to go and get information on the treatments provided by practice.  By creating a site that is not only visually appealing but also filled with the information needed by the clients; the site should allow the practice to bring in more customers from a broader area.  A website can be a great tool in getting your word out and allowing a place for people to learn more about what is going on without actually coming in to speak with the doctor</p>   

    	</div>	
    	<div id="materials">
        	<h2>Needs Analysis</h2>
        		<p>This site will be setup to answer the following questions, and provide information in the following areas:</p>
        		<ul class="resources">
        			<li>Giving an about page for the doctor</li>
        			<li>Providing information about the treatments given</li>
        			<li>Giving information about the conditions treated</li>
        			<li>Displaying a picture of the doctor to make personal</li>
        			<li>Have a contact page to get ahold of the practice</li>
        		</ul>
    	</div>
    	<div>
        	<h2>Goals</h2>
        		<ol class="resources">
        			<li>Provide an online area to provide more information on the practice</li>
        			<li>Bring in more business by providing another place of advertisement</li>
        			<li>Give a place for people to easily go and contact the practice</li>
        		</ol>
        	<h2>Audience Characteristics</h2>
        	<p>The following are the typical characteristics that visitors to the site will have</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>Will be a patient experiencing pain</li>
        		<li>A family member of somebody experiencing pain</li>
        		<li>Somebody the doctor has already treated</li>
        		<li>Somebody the doctor has already met with about treatments</li>
        		<li>People looking for a doctor to help with pain</li>
        		<li>Possibly other doctors</li>
        	</ul>
        	<h2>Primary Audience</h2>
        	<p>The primary audience will be anybody looking for a physician who can provide them pain relief in a variety of different procedures or medications.  This patients can log onto the site and find any information that they want about the treatments and conditions that the doctor works with.  They can learn more about the doctor and his background, as well as find contact information for the office</p>
    		<h2>Secondary Audience</h2>
    		<p>The secondary audience might be other physicians or nurses or maybe even drug representatives looking to contact the doctor for any number of reasons.  Another physician could be looking for a reliable pain specialist to send their patients to after a surgery or simply to consult on something with.</p>
    		<h2>Competition</h2>
    		<h3><a href="http://www.midwestpain.net/">MidWest Pain</a></h3>
    		<p>The page is nice and clean with a menu bar across the top.  They have about the same categories, except they also include a few more such as "patient education" and "employment".  The site is also set-up for a practice that has multiple doctors as opposed to only one.  This is a simple and clean website that could provide great insight on how to structure ours.</p>
    		<h3><a href="http://www.inter-pain.com/">Advance Intervention Pain Center</a></h3>
    		<p>Again the site is clean and simple.   It is also a bit more animated with things moving and sliding across the screen as you scroll.  Sometimes this can be a nuisance but they have been able to do it in a clean way.  They have professional use of picture and the layout is fantastic.  In order to make our website standout, taking the positives that make these websites nice will have to be expanded upon to encapsulate them and include things that make ours stand out</p>

    		<h2>Testing Data</h2>
    			<h3>Validation</h3>
    				<p>
    					Both the testing data for all of the HTML and CSS pages show zero errors.
    				</p>
    			<h3>Flexibility</h3>
    				<p>
    					I tried zooming in and adjusting the font sizes for the browsers and 
    					everything seem to work out just right, varying in size proportionally.  
    					I also created and min-width style for all of the main sections of the 
    					pages so that once the browser becomes too small it just simply goes off 
    					of the page instead of bunching up.
    				</p>
    			<h3>Speed Testing</h3>
    				<dl>

    			<h3>Accessibility (508 compliance)</h3>
    				<a href="../myBlog/images/508.jpg"><img src="../myBlog/images/508Web.jpg" alt="508 picture"></a>
    			<h3>Browser Independence</h3>
    				<p>
    				The site was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, all giving about the same results.
    				</p>
    		<h2>Post-Project Analysis</h2>
    			<h3>What parts of your project did you revise? Why?</h3>
    				<p>
    					After testing the site, I had to add and change around a few things in order 
    					for it to meet standards.  I had to add some alt attributes into a few of 
    					the photos, I had to fix places where I didn't use the closing tags properly,
    					and I had to add a min-width style to parts of the pages to account for 
    					window resizing.  I also had to change the fonts to percentages for this 
    					reason as well.
    				</p>
    			<h3>What did you learn while creating your project?</h3>
    				<p>
    					I learned that it is hard work and that in order for you to get your site 
    					the way you want it, you cannot expect to get it right off of the bat.  You 
    					must be okay and ready for many many stages of trial and error, debugging, 
    					rechecking, and repeat.  You have to do this over and over again.  It is fun 
    					though and the small victories are truly intoxicating actually.
    				</p>
    			<h3>Are there any sections that do not work as well as you would like? For example, do your pages display correctly in all major browsers?</h3>
    				<p>
    					Umm, nope not really, I spent a lot of time with my website, far more than I did 
    					for any of the other labs and I believe I got it just where I want it.  Now, of course 
    					I plan on continuing to improve on it but that comes more with learning how to do 
    					new things, as far as what I know currently, this is exactly the way that I want it.
